# IQ Architecture

## Overview

IQ is a local generative AI system for Apple Silicon, capable of running LLMs entirely offline with no cloud dependency. The **`iq`** CLI binary orchestrates this system — managing model downloads, tier assignment, cue definitions, knowledge base access, sidecar processes, and intelligent prompt routing — all from a unified command-line interface.

## Components

### Model Management

The **`iq lm`** command handles the full model lifecycle. Models are downloaded from [mlx-community](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=mlx) via the `hf` CLI and stored in the standard HuggingFace cache at `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`. A manifest at `~/.config/iq/models.json` tracks what IQ knows about.

Key operations: `search`, `get`, `list`, `show`, `rm`.

`iq lm search` queries the HF API, enriches results in parallel (one goroutine per model) to populate DISK and EST MEM, and displays TASK / DISK / PARAMS / EST MEM / DOWNLOADS. The TASK column shows the HuggingFace `pipeline_tag` as-is (e.g. `text-generation`, `image-text-to-text`) — green for supported text-generation models, red for unsupported types. Accepts an optional query string or a numeric count (e.g. `iq lm search 100`).

`iq lm get` checks the model's task type before downloading; if it is not `text-generation`, a yellow warning is printed (download proceeds anyway). After download, the `pipeline_tag` is cached in the manifest for offline display. Infers a suggested tier from disk size (< 2GB → fast, else slow) and prints the `iq svc tier add` command to assign it.

`iq lm list` displays TASK alongside DISK / PULLED / PARAMS / EST MEM / TIER. On first display, missing task tags are backfilled from the HF API in parallel (with local `config.json` inference as fallback) and persisted to the manifest.

`iq lm show` displays the TASK field (backfilled from HF API or local `config.json` inference if not cached).

**Local task inference** (`inferTaskFromConfig`) — when the HF API returns no `pipeline_tag`, IQ reads the model's local `config.json` and infers the task: vision indicator keys (`vision_config`, `visual`, `vision_tower`, `image_size`) or known VLM `model_type` values → `image-text-to-text`; known text-generation `model_type` values (only after confirming no vision indicators) → `text-generation`.

`iq lm rm` refuses to remove a model assigned to a tier or whose sidecar is running.

### Configuration

Manages `~/.config/iq/config.yaml`. Configuration commands live under `iq svc` — there is no separate `iq cfg` command. Tiers are **pools** — each tier holds a list of model IDs, not a single slot.

```
fast    sub-2GB models — used for quick inference tasks
slow    2GB+ models    — used for quality inference
```

Tier commands: `iq svc tier show`, `iq svc tier add <tier> <model>`, `iq svc tier rm <tier> <model>`.

Embed model commands: `iq svc embed show`, `iq svc embed set <model>`, `iq svc embed rm`.

Auto-migration: on first load, an old four-tier config (`tiny`/`fast`/`balanced`/`quality`) is silently converted to the two-tier pool format using the 2GB disk threshold. Legacy `cue_model`/`kb_model` fields are auto-migrated to the unified `embed_model`.

### Cue Definitions

The **`iq cue`** command manages `~/.config/iq/cues.yaml`, seeded from an embedded default set of 17 cues across 8 categories.

```
general  code  reasoning  language_tasks  generation  summarization  safety  domain
```

Each cue carries a `name`, `category`, `description`, `system_prompt`, `suggested_tier`, and an optional direct `model` override (kept for power users, not actively promoted in routing).

Commands: `list`, `show`, `add`, `edit`, `rm`, `assign`, `unassign`, `reset`, `sync`.

`sync` merges new factory cues into an existing `cues.yaml` without overwriting user customisations — useful when upgrading IQ to a version that adds new cues.

### Service Daemon

The **`iq svc`** command manages sidecar processes. Each sidecar runs as a detached `infer_server.py` process (a custom MLX inference server embedded in the Go binary, written to a temp file at startup). Ports are assigned dynamically starting at 27001. State is persisted to `~/.config/iq/run/<model-slug>.json` (PID, port, tier, model, start time), and logs go to `~/.config/iq/run/<model-slug>.log`.

Start sequence:
1. Allocate next free port from 27001+
2. Resolve HF snapshot directory (`snapshots/<hash>/`) — the `--model` path
3. **VLM guard** — read `config.json` and reject vision-language models (checks for `vision_config`, `vision_tower`, `image_size` keys and known VLM `model_type` values). `mlx_lm.load` cannot handle vision weights.
4. Locate Python interpreter from the `mlx-lm` pipx venv; write embedded `infer_server.py` to temp dir
5. Spawn detached subprocess (`Setsid: true`)
6. Poll `GET /v1/models` until 200 OK or 120s timeout. A background goroutine calls `cmd.Wait()` to detect early crashes reliably (avoids zombie-pid false positives from signal-0 checks).
7. On failure: print last 10 log lines + path

`iq svc start/stop` accepts a tier name (acts on the whole pool), a model ID (acts on one), or no argument (all assigned models). On first run with no tiers configured, `iq svc start` prints a recommended setup with example `iq lm get` and `iq svc tier add` commands.

**Pool dispatcher (`pickSidecar`)** — scans live state files for a given tier and returns one. With `preferSmallest: true`, it returns the model with the smallest disk footprint (used by the auto-naming background goroutine).

`iq svc doc` checks runtime dependencies: `python3` available, `mlx_lm.server` found (needed for its venv Python) and `--model` flag supported, `mlx-embedding-models` package installed, all assigned model HuggingFace cache dirs exist.

**Embeddings** — handled by a single local Python sidecar (`embed_model`, port 27000) started with `iq svc start`. Serves cue classification, tool detection, and KB indexing/retrieval. Configure via `iq svc embed`.

`iq svc status` (also available as `iq status` / `iq st`) shows TIER / MODEL / ENDPOINT / PID / UPTIME / MEM for all assigned models plus the embed sidecar row, IQ process memory, and combined total.

### Knowledge Base

The **`iq kb`** command manages `~/.config/iq/kb.json`, an embedded vector index used for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

> **What RAG is.** Large language models know only what was in their training data. RAG extends this by retrieving relevant passages from your own documents at query time and injecting them into the prompt as plain text context — no fine-tuning, no model modification. The model reasons over retrieved material just as it would any other text in its context window. The key insight: embeddings are used for *retrieval* (finding relevant passages by semantic similarity), but the model itself only ever sees text. Embeddings never enter the model directly in this architecture.

**How it works end-to-end:**

```
iq kb ingest ~/projects/myapp
    │
    ├── walk directory (skips .git, node_modules, vendor, __pycache__, hidden dirs)
    ├── read each text file (.go, .md, .py, .yaml, ...)
    ├── structure-aware chunking (see below)
    ├── embed each chunk via embed sidecar :27000 (batches of 20)
    └── store chunk text + 384-float vector in kb.json

iq ask "how does the auth middleware work?"
    │
    ├── embed user input → query vector
    ├── hybrid scoring: cosine_similarity + keyword boost — Go, in-memory
    ├── top-3 chunks retrieved (score ≥ 0.72 threshold)
    ├── injected as plain text context in user message:
    │     "Relevant context from knowledge base:
    │      KB Result Chunk 01: /path/to/middleware.go (lines 42–81)
    │      <chunk text>
    │      KB Result Chunk 02: /path/to/README.md (lines 12–51)
    │      <chunk text>"
    └── inference proceeds as normal — model sees your actual code
```

**Chunking strategies** — the chunker dispatches by file type for structure-aware splits:

| File type | Strategy | Boundaries |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| `.go` | Declaration-based | Each top-level `func`, `type`, `var`, `const` = one chunk |
| `.md` | Heading-based | Each heading + its content body = one chunk; label carries full heading path |
| `.yaml`, `.yml`, `.toml` | Key-value blocks | Top-level key groups |
| Everything else | Prose/paragraph | Paragraphs grouped up to 1600 runes per chunk |

Each chunk text is prefixed with `File: path/to/file.go` metadata before embedding to improve retrieval relevance.

**Hybrid scoring** — KB search combines cosine similarity with keyword boosting. `extractKeywords` pulls meaningful tokens from the query (splits on whitespace/punctuation, expands camelCase, keeps tokens ≥ 4 chars). Each keyword found in a chunk adds +0.05; function call patterns (`keyword(`) add an extra +0.12 to surface callsites over definitions. Total keyword boost is capped at +0.25.

KB retrieval is **always-on** when `kb.json` exists and the embed sidecar is running. Disable per-prompt with `-K / --no-kb`. The `-d / --debug` flag adds a STEP 3 KB RETRIEVE trace showing each chunk's source, line range, and similarity score.

Commands: `ingest` (alias: `in`), `list`, `search`, `rm`, `clear`.

```
iq kb ingest <path>     # file or directory tree
iq kb in <path>         # alias
iq kb list              # show sources with file/chunk counts and ingest time
iq kb search <query>    # raw similarity search — shows score + preview, no inference
iq kb rm <path>         # remove a source and all its chunks
iq kb clear             # wipe entire kb.json
```

`iq pry` also supports KB retrieval via `-k / --kb`.

### Inference and REPL

The **`iq ask`** command provides an interactive REPL. One-shot prompts can also be sent directly via `iq "message"`, which routes through the same pipeline. The `ask` subcommand remains available as an explicit alias.

Routes user prompts through a 6-step pipeline:

**Step 1 — CLASSIFY.** The user input is embedded via the embed sidecar (:27000) and compared against pre-computed embeddings of all cue descriptions via cosine similarity. The highest-scoring cue is selected (minimum score threshold: 0.40). No generative call, no instruction-following dependency, deterministic result. Falls back to `initial` if the embed sidecar is not running.

> **What embeddings are.** An embedding is a fixed-size vector of numbers — in IQ's case, 384 floats — that a neural network uses to represent the meaning of a piece of text. Networks trained on large corpora learn to place semantically similar content close together in this high-dimensional space: "explain a transformer model" and "describe how attention works" will produce vectors pointing in nearly the same direction even though they share no words. This numerical representation of meaning is the bridge between raw data and neural cognition. It enables similarity search and retrieval (vector DBs), routing and classification without generative inference, memory systems in agentic AI, and multi-modal fusion (images and text embedded into the same space so they can be compared directly). In IQ, embeddings serve triple duty: classifying prompts to cues, detecting when tools are needed, and retrieving relevant knowledge base chunks for RAG.

The cue embedding cache (`~/.config/iq/cue_embeddings.json`) is built on first use and refreshed automatically when cues change.

**Step 1b — TOOL DETECT.** Determines whether to enable read-only tools for this prompt. Three detection paths, checked in order:

1. **Forced** — `-T` flag forces tools on; `--no-tools` forces them off.
2. **File-path heuristic** — deterministic check for slash-separated paths (excluding URLs) or words ending in known source-code extensions (`.go`, `.py`, `.md`, `.json`, etc.).
3. **Embed-based signal matching** — reuses the input vector already computed in Step 1 (zero extra API calls). Compares against 4 pre-embedded tool signal descriptions via cosine similarity. If the best match exceeds the tool threshold (0.66), tools are enabled.

The 4 tool signals and the tools they cover:

| Signal | Tools | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `time_date` | `get_time` | Time, date, day of the week |
| `file_access` | `read_file`, `list_dir`, `file_info` | Read/list files, file metadata |
| `file_search` | `search_text`, `count_lines` | Search for text in files, count lines |
| `calculation` | `calc` | Math expressions, percentages, arithmetic |

Tool signal embeddings are cached in `~/.config/iq/tool_embeddings.json` and versioned with an FNV32a hash over signal names and descriptions so they auto-refresh when signals change.

**Step 2 — ROUTE.** Resolves sidecar from the cue. Priority: cue direct model override → cue `suggested_tier` → fast fallback → cross-tier fallback → error.

**Step 3 — KB RETRIEVE.** If `kb.json` exists and the embed sidecar is running (and `--no-kb` is not set), the top-3 most similar chunks are retrieved via hybrid scoring and injected as plain text context in the user message. Skipped silently if KB is empty or unavailable.

**Step 4 — ASSEMBLE.** Combines system prompt (from cue, plus tool instructions if tools enabled), session history (if any), and user message (with KB context prepended if any) into the structured message array sent to inference.

**Step 4b — CACHE CHECK.** Computes an FNV64a hash over the assembled message array and model ID, then looks up the hash in `~/.config/iq/response_cache.json`. On a hit (entry exists and is within the 1-hour TTL), the cached response is returned immediately and inference is skipped entirely. Disabled in session mode, when tools are enabled (tool results depend on live execution), and via `--no-cache`.

**Step 5 — INFERENCE LOOP.** Sends to the target sidecar via `POST /v1/chat/completions`. Non-tool path streams tokens to stdout by default.

When tools are enabled, inference runs in a non-streaming loop driven entirely by IQ's Go code:
1. **Pass 1 — routing grammar.** The request includes a `routing_grammar` field listing available tool names. The custom `infer_server.py` sidecar uses a `RoutingGrammarProcessor` (logits processor) to constrain the model's first tokens to one of `<tool:NAME>` or `<no_tool>`, then generates freely. This forces a structural routing decision before the model can fabricate an answer.
2. **Route parse.** IQ parses the routing prefix with `parseRoutingPrefix()`. If `<tool:NAME>`, IQ constructs a `toolCall`, executes the tool, injects the result, and calls the model again (pass 2) to format the final answer.
3. **Tool guard.** If the model chose `<no_tool>` but Step 1b detected a tool signal via embedding, IQ directly executes the expected tool (bypassing the model), injects the result, and calls the model to format the answer. This handles cases where small models pick `<no_tool>` despite clear tool intent.
4. **Passes 2+ — standard tool loop** (up to 5 iterations). IQ's parser extracts `<tool_call>` blocks — handles correct JSON, broken JSON (regex fallback), wrong tag names (`<get_time>` instead of `<tool_call>`), unclosed tags, and markdown-fenced JSON. IQ validates and executes each tool; results are injected as user messages. Loop ends when the model produces a response with no tool calls, or after 5 iterations.

**Thinking model support** — models like DeepSeek-R1 that emit `<think>...</think>` reasoning blocks are handled transparently: during streaming, think-block tokens are buffered in memory (not echoed to the user); the clean result is printed after stripping. Non-streaming mode strips think blocks from the full response.

**Step 5b — CACHE WRITE.** On a cache miss, stores the inference response in `response_cache.json` keyed by the same FNV64a hash from Step 4b. Expired entries (>1 hour) are pruned on write. Skipped when cache is disabled or session mode is active.

**Step 6 — PERSIST.** Appends the turn to `~/.config/iq/sessions/<id>.yaml`. After the first exchange, a background goroutine asks the smallest fast-tier model to generate a short name (≤ 5 words) and description (≤ 15 words) for the session.

**Flags:**
```
-r, --cue <n>       Skip classification, use this cue directly
-c, --category <n>  Restrict auto-classification to one category
    --tier <n>      Override tier directly, bypass cue system
-s, --session <id>  Load/continue a named session
-K, --no-kb         Disable knowledge base retrieval for this prompt
    --no-cache      Disable response cache
-T, --tools         Force enable read-only tool use
    --no-tools      Disable tool use
-n, --dry-run       Trace steps 1–4, skip inference
-d, --debug         Trace all steps including inference
    --no-stream     Collect full response before printing
```

**REPL mode** — entered when no message arg and stdin is a terminal. Supports `/cue`, `/session`, `/clear`, `/dry-run`, `/debug`, `/tools` (cycles auto → on → off → auto), `/help`, `/quit`. Pipe-friendly: `echo "..." | iq ask` takes the stdin path.

### Tools

> **How tool use actually works.** The model never executes anything — it is a sandboxed token predictor with no OS access, no network, and no file system. What happens: IQ's system prompt gives the model a list of tool definitions (name, description, parameter schema). When the model decides a tool would help, it emits a structured `<tool_call>` block — not an execution, just a formatted request. IQ's Go code detects that syntax, validates the call, runs the actual function, and injects the result back into the conversation as a new message. The model then continues from there. The "agentic" behaviour is a loop IQ drives: call model → check for tool calls → execute tool → append result → call model again → repeat until the model emits a plain-text response. The model cannot initiate anything between turns, cannot run in the background, and cannot do anything IQ's harness code does not explicitly handle. This is why all tools are read-only and file paths are validated before execution — IQ is the one pulling the trigger.

In **ask mode** (via `iq "<prompt>"` or `iq ask "<prompt>"`), seven read-only tools are available. All file-access tools enforce path security: only the current working directory and paths listed in `config.yaml` `tool_paths` are allowed. Paths are resolved through symlinks and checked via prefix matching.

| Tool | Parameters | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `get_time` | *(none)* | Current date, time, timezone, day of week |
| `read_file` | `path` (required) | Read file contents (max 64KB) |
| `list_dir` | `path` (required) | List directory entries |
| `file_info` | `path` (required) | File size, modification time, permissions |
| `calc` | `expression` (required) | Evaluate math: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, parentheses, decimals |
| `search_text` | `pattern` (required), `path` | Regex search across files (max 50 matches, skips .git/vendor/etc.) |
| `count_lines` | `path` (required) | Count lines in a file |

The tool system prompt (`buildRoutingToolPrompt`) is appended to the system message when tools are active. It lists all available tools with their parameter schemas and instructs the model to emit `<tool:TOOL_NAME>` (followed by JSON arguments) or `<no_tool>` (followed by a direct answer) as its first output. The routing grammar logits processor enforces this structurally.

### Raw Sidecar Access

The **`iq pry`** command bypasses the IQ prompt pipeline, sending a message directly to a specific sidecar for debugging and model exploration.


```
iq pry <model|tier> [flags] <message>

-c, --cue <n>       Use a cue's system prompt
-s, --system <text> Use a literal system prompt
-k, --kb            Retrieve knowledge base context (prepended to system prompt)
-S, --no-stream     Collect full response before printing
```

`--cue` and `--system` are mutually exclusive. Accepts a tier name or specific model ID. Prints routing info in gray before the response and elapsed time after.

### Benchmarking

The **`iq perf`** command evaluates model performance using an embedded benchmark corpus. Results are stored in `~/.config/iq/benchmarks.json`.

Benchmark types:
- **KB retrieval** — measures search quality (MRR = Mean Reciprocal Rank)
- **Cue classification** — measures accuracy and average similarity score against the embedded benchmark corpus
- **Inference latency** — measures P50/P95 latency and throughput

Commands:
```
iq perf bench [--type <type>] [--model <id>]   # run benchmarks
iq perf show [model] [type]                     # display stored results
iq perf clear                                   # wipe benchmark history
```

### Embed Sidecar

A single Python process (`embed_server.py`, embedded in the Go binary) runs on port 27000. It uses `mlx-embedding-models` to serve embedding requests over HTTP.

**Model-specific handling:**
- **nomic** models: `"search_query: "` / `"search_document: "` instruction prefixes
- **mxbai** models: `"Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages: "` prefix (query only)
- **bge** models (default): no prefix, max 1600 runes per text

The default embed model is `mlx-community/bge-small-en-v1.5-bf16` (384-dimensional vectors).

**Dependencies:**
```
pipx install mlx-lm
pipx inject mlx-lm mlx-embedding-models
```

### Web Search Library (`search.go`)

A DuckDuckGo client library is included as infrastructure. It provides `Search()` and `SearchWithOption()` functions for HTML scraping with retry logic for 202 throttling responses. Currently available for future tool integration but not wired into any user-facing command.

## Data Flow: Prompt Execution

The diagram below shows how a user prompt flows through IQ’s internal pipeline, from ingestion to final output. All steps are executed locally via sidecars and orchestrated by the CLI, incorporating cue classification, tool detection, knowledge base retrieval, caching, inference, and session persistence.

## Debug Trace Format

IQ prints a detailed **debug trace** of each step when run with **`-d` or `--debug`**. Each step prints a clean header and structured sub-fields:

```
STEP 1  CLASSIFY
  task          Cosine-similarity match user input against 17 cue descriptions
  call          embed bge-small-en-v1.5-bf16 @ localhost:27000
  resolved_cue  initial (score: 0.5457)
  elapsed       40ms

STEP 1b TOOL DETECT
  task          Cosine-similarity match input vector against 4 tool signal descriptions
  best_signal   time_date (score: 0.72)
  result        enabled (embed)
  elapsed       1ms

STEP 2  RESOLVE ROUTE
  task          Map resolved cue to model tier and running sidecar
  model         Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-4bit @ localhost:27001
  cue           initial → general/fast
  tier_source   suggested_tier
  elapsed       0ms

STEP 3  KB RETRIEVE
  task          Cosine-similarity search user input against KB chunks
  call          embed bge-small-en-v1.5-bf16 @ localhost:27000
  chunks        3 results
  top           score:0.7219  svc.go:245–264
  elapsed       65ms

STEP 4  ASSEMBLE
  task          Combine system prompt, session history, and user message into message array
  [system]
    ...
  [user]
    ...

STEP 4b CACHE CHECK
  task          Hash messages and check response cache
  key           a3f7c2e1deadbeef
  result        miss
  elapsed       0ms

STEP 5  INFERENCE LOOP
  task          Send assembled messages to model sidecar for generation
  call          POST localhost:27001/v1/chat/completions (pass 1, routing grammar)
  raw_resp      "<tool:get_time>"
  route         <tool:get_time>
  tool_call     get_time(null)
  tool_result   2026-03-02 08:55:00 EST (Monday)
  call          POST localhost:27001/v1/chat/completions (pass 2)
  raw_resp      "The current time is..."
  elapsed       1200ms

  # If grammar chose <no_tool> but Step 1b detected a signal:
  # route         <no_tool>
  # guard         <no_tool> but signal=time_date — direct-calling get_time
  # tool_call     get_time(null)
  # tool_result   2026-03-02 08:55:00 EST (Monday)
  # call          POST localhost:27001/v1/chat/completions (pass 2, after guard)
  # raw_resp      "The current time is..."

STEP 5b CACHE WRITE
  task          Store response in cache
  key           a3f7c2e1deadbeef
  ttl           60m
  elapsed       0ms

STEP 6  SESSION
  task          Persist conversation to disk
  id            abc123
  saved         ~/.config/iq/sessions/abc123.yaml
  turns         1
  elapsed       0ms
```

Dry-run mode (`-n`) prints Steps 1–4 only, skipping inference.
